<t>
This document specifies an OPTIONAL extension
to NFS version 4 minor version 2
that enables Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture metadata (IMA)
to be conveyed between NFS version 4.2 servers and clients.
Integrity measurement
authenticates the creator of a file's content and
helps guarantee the content's integrity
end-to-end from creation to use.

<t>
The security of software distribution systems
is complex and challenging,
especially as software distribution
has become increasingly decentralized.
An end administrator needs to trust that she is running
executables just as they are supplied by a software vendor;
in other words, that they have not been modified by malicious actors,
contracted system administration services, or broken hardware or software.
Software vendors want a guarantee that customer-installed executables
that fall under support contracts have similarly not been modified.
</t>
<t>
There already exist mechanisms that protect file data
during certain portions of a file's life cycle:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Whole file system checksumming can verify so-called
Golden Master installation media before it is used
to install the software it contains.
</t>
<t>
File or block integrity mechanisms can protect data
at rest on storage servers.
</t>
<t>
For a distributed file system such as NFS,
transport layer security or a GSS integrity service
(as described in
<xref target="RFC7861"/>)
can protect data while it traverses a network
between a storage server and a client.
</t>
</list>
A more extensive mechanism is needed to guarantee
that no modification of a particular file has occurred
since it was created,
perhaps even after several generations of copies
have been made of the file's content.
</t>

<section
 title="The Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture"

<t>
The Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)
<xref target="SAILER"/>
provides assurance
that the content of a file is unaltered and authentic to what was
originally written to that file.
The goal is to detect when
an attacker,
unintentional platform behavior,
or
local tinkering
has modified the content of a file,
either in transit or at rest.
</t>
<t>
This is done by separately storing metadata about a file's content
and then using that metadata to verify the content before it is used.
Verification of the content is entirely independent of the file system.
File systems, both local and remote, act simply as storage for both the
content and the metadata, both of which are opaque to the storage subsystem.
</t>
<t>
An informative description of this mechanism
is presented in the following subsections
to provide context for understanding the NFS protocol extension
described later in this document.
As the file system does not interpret IMA metadata,
this description is not necessary to implement the extension.
</t>

<section
 title="IMA Metadata"
 anchor="section:61675D23-3584-407E-BBB3-346DD170BFA1">
<t>
First, it is important to understand the distinction between
a checksum,
a hash,
and a cryptographically-signed hash.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A checksum, or parity, is designed to detect and possibly correct
one or two bit errors in a fixed amount of content.
</t>
<t>
A hash's purpose is to detect both accidental and malicious
alterations.
Typically a hash is a small fixed size, but can be computed
over a very large amount of content.
</t>
<t>
A cryptographically-signed hash is the basis for a digital signature.
The signatory of a cryptographically-signed hash gives a guarantee
that the hash, and therefore the hashed content, has not been changed,
since the hash was signed.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
A cryptographically-signed hash
stored separately from a file's content therefore
serves as a strong check of file content integrity
and
authenticates the identity of the provider of the file's content.
The signer is verified at time of content use
via a web of trust commonly provided by PKI or
x.509 certificates
<xref target="RFC4158"/>.
</t>
<t>
The hash is typically computed using
either the SHA-1 or SHA-256 algorithm
and is stored as an HMAC
<xref target="RFC2104"/>.
For the purposes of this document,
the current document refers to this blob as "IMA metadata".
</t>
<t>
The precise format of this metadata is determined by policies
set by the local security administrator;
the metadata and its format are opaque to the mechanisms that store
or transport it (i.e., file systems).
The particulars of the PKI and the hash algorithm are
set by local policy, which is agreed upon out-of-band
and recognized by all participating IMA subsystems.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Creating and Verifying IMA Metadata"
 anchor="section:F6A13064-1B7B-4848-B172-431EAF1D4819">
<t>
In a typical deployment, an authority (such as a software vendor)
computes the hash of a file after its content has been finalized.
The hash is then signed and attached to the file.
A web of trust typically links
the signer to the users of the file's content
(such as customers of the software vendor).
</t>
<t>
Directly before file content is to be used,
a security module locally re-computes the hash of the file content
and stores it in a cache.
This step is known as "measurement".
</t>
<t>
The next step is referred to as "appraisal".
The security module then reads the associated IMA metadata
and validates its signature.
If the signature is invalid or
the locally computed hash does not match the stored hash,
the security module applies an appraisal policy.
The file may be flagged in an audit log or
access to the file may be denied.
</t>
<t>
Underlying file and storage systems play no part in measurement or appraisal.
They act only as a conduit by which
file content
and
IMA metadata
move between at-rest storage
and the security module on the host where that content is to be used.
Both IMA metadata and file content are opaque to storage subsystems.

Unprotected keys are not stored in or distributed via file systems.
Distributing and protecting such key material is outside the scope
of the extension specified in this document.

<section
 title="Using IMA to Protect NFS Files"
 anchor="section:61F4E746-933C-47A0-AEAD-EB165B5F53A4">
<t>
The protocol extension in this document enables
the storage and use of IMA metadata
so that measurement and appraisal can occur at point-of-use
on NFS client and server hosts.
This mechanism is similar to NFSv4 Security Labels
(specified in
<xref target="RFC7862"/>
et al).
The purpose of the mechanism defined in the current document is
to store security-related file metadata
that is not interpreted by the file system itself.
</t>

<section
 title="An Illustrative Use Case"
 anchor="section:DFCFDF63-1A15-4DC2-958A-9CD6BABF9F65">
<t>
To help the reader grasp how IMA on NFS might be used in practice,
this section contains a decription of an IMA use case.
The purpose of using IMA here is to provide a guarantee that a
set of users that are executing a commercial software product
are indeed using the same binary executable and libraries
that were developed and tested by the product's vendor.
</t>
<t>
To publish a software product, a vendor might do the following:
<list style="numbers">
<t>
The vendor generates a key pair and publishes the public key.
</t>
<t>
The vendor finalizes a version of its software product.
</t>
<t>
The vendor generates a hash of each file in the product's
distribution manifest, and signs each hash with its private key.
</t>
<t>
The vendor publishes the product's files and the signed hashes.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
To install and use the vendor's product, a customer might do
the following:
<list style="numbers">
<t>
The customer installs the files and the signed hashes in a
local filesystem.
</t>
<t>
When a user executes one of the files, a local security module
reads the file from disk and computes a hash of its content.
This is the measurement step, which happens when each file
is loaded into the system's page cache.
</t>
<t>
The security module uses the vendor's public key to verify
the signature of the file's stored hash, and confirms that the
locally computed hash matches the stored hash.
This is the appraisal step, which happens when each file is
about to be executed.
</t>
<t>
If the locally computed hash is verified, the security module
allows the operating system to execute the program.
If not, then the program fails to execute and an integrity
error is logged.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The purpose of the NFS extension specified in the current document
is to enable the signed hashes in the above example to be stored
by an NFS server and retrieved by NFS clients.
Each NFS client could then verify that neither the NFS server nor
an active network agent had altered file content before it was
used on the NFS client.
</t>

<section
 title="Protocol Extension Considerations"
 anchor="section:EE671D6C-D026-4935-BDB5-D905E3EB6F66">
<t>
This document specifies an OPTIONAL extension to
NFS version 4 minor version 2
<xref target="RFC7862"/>,
hereafter referred to as NFS version 4.2.
NFS version 4.2 servers and clients implemented
without knowledge of this extension will continue to interoperate
with NFS version 4.2 clients and servers
that are aware of the extension, whether or not they support it.
</t>
<t>
Because
<xref target="RFC7862"/>
does not define NFS version 4.2 as non-extensible,
<xref target="RFC8178"/>
treats it as an extensible minor version.
Therefore this Standards Track RFC extends NFS version 4.2
but does not update
<xref target="RFC7862"/>
or
<xref target="RFC7863"/>.
</t>

<section
 title="XDR Extraction"
 anchor="section:F6B86801-63FC-4B65-B16E-C62AB12078D0">
<t>
<xref target="section:E7540F27-9406-454D-9FBE-B2EAC79A3920"/>
contains a description of an extension to the NFS version 4.2 protocol,
expressed in the External Data Representation (XDR) language
<xref target="RFC4506"/>.
This description is provided in a way that makes it simple
to extract into ready-to-compile form.
The reader can apply the following sed script to this
document to produce a machine-readable XDR description of
the extension.

&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;

sed -n -e 's:^ */// ::p' -e 's:^ *///$::p'

&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
That is, if this document is in a file called "ima-extension.txt"
then the reader can do the following to extract an XDR description file:
<figure align="left">
<artwork xml:space="preserve" align="left">
&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;

sed -n -e 's:^ */// ::p' -e 's:^ *///$::p'
     &lt; ima-extension.txt &gt; ima.x

&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
Once that extraction is done, these added lines need to be inserted into
an appropriate base XDR of the generated XDR from
<xref target="RFC7863"/>
together with XDR from any additional extensions to be recognized by
the implementation.
This will result in a ready-to-compile XDR file.

<section
 title="Detecting support for IMA Metadata"
 anchor="section:49517532-7084-4F57-A9E0-E6D9E539BD66">
<t>
An NFS version 4.2 client discovers support for IMA metadata
on an NFS version 4.2 server by sending an NFS GETATTR operation
that specifies the FATTR4_SUPPORTED_ATTRS attribute and
the FATTR4_IMA attribute.
When a server supports IMA metadata, it sets the FATTR4_IMA
attribute bit in the NFS GETATTR bitmask returned in the reply.
Otherwise that bit is clear.
</t>
<t>
An NFS version 4.2 server MUST NOT return NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY to a client
unless that client has queried the server for IMA metadata support
using the above mechanism.
The server identifies clients using their client_id4 for this purpose.
</t>

<section
 title="Reporting Server-Side IMA Appraisal Failures"
 anchor="section:845E57CD-BE87-4B6F-BD81-515474D9AAC8">
<t>
An NFS server that has rigorous integrity checking must
somehow report integrity-related failures to clients.
Until now, a server implementer chose amongst status codes
that were available in the base NFS version 4.2 protocol,
typically NFS4ERR_IO or NFS4ERR_ACCESS, even though these
code points have generic meanings that do not necessarily imply
an integrity-related failure.
</t>
<t>
Once the above FATTR4_SUPPORTED_ATTRS handshake is done,
the server has determined that a client
can properly recognize the NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY status code.
In instances where an NFS request fails
due to an integrity-related issue,
and the server has determined that the client recognizes
the NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY status code,
the server MAY return NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY for the following operations:
ACCESS,
COMMIT,
CREATE,
GETATTR,
GETDEVICELIST,
LINK,
LOOKUP,
LOOKUPP,
NVERIFY,
OPEN,
OPENATTR,
READ,
READDIR,
READLINK,
REMOVE,
RENAME,
SETATTR,
VERIFY,
WRITE.
The server MUST NOT return NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY for any other operation.
</t>
<t>
The NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY status code is useful to inform the client
(or the end user, depending on the client implementation)
that access to the file's content was not blocked because of a
permissions setting but rather because an integrity check failed.
This distinction can guide the user or client towards a recovery
action that is appropriate.
</t>

</section>

<section
 title="Storing IMA Metadata"
 anchor="section:7167B240-32ED-47DB-903E-874A3A43FF9B">
<t>
An NFS version 4.2 client stores IMA metadata
by sending an NFS SETATTR operation
that specifies the FATTR4_IMA attribute and
targets the file system object
associated with the metadata to be stored.
This attribute completely replaces any previous FATTR4_IMA attribute
associated with that object.
Modifying an object in any other way MUST NOT alter or remove
FATTR4_IMA attributes.
</t>
<t>
To remove IMA metadata from an object,
the client sends a FATTR4_IMA attribute
whose length is zero.
</t>
<t>
When an NFS SETATTR is presented to an NFS version 4.2 server
with a credential that is not authorized
to replace a FATTR4_IMA attribute,
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_ACCESS.
</t>
<t>
When an NFS SETATTR is presented to an NFS version 4.2 server
with an ima_data4 field
whose length is larger than 4096 bytes,
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_INVAL.
</t>
<t>
When an NFS SETATTR is presented to an NFS version 4.2 server
and the target object resides in a file system
which supports FATTR4_IMA
but the object itself does not support the FATTR4_IMA attribute,
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_WRONGTYPE.
For example, if the server's file system supports associating
IMA metadata with regular files but not with sockets or FIFOs,
then the result of an attempt to associate IMA metadata with a FIFO
will be NFS4ERR_WRONGTYPE.
</t>
<t>
When an NFS SETATTR is presented to an NFS version 4.2 server
but the target object resides in a file system which does not
support the FATTR4_IMA attribute,
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP.
</t>
<t>
When a client presents an NFS SETATTR that modifies FATTR4_IMA
along with other attributes and the server responds with
an error, the client can retry setting each attribute
separately to sort out which attribute is causing the
server to reject the NFS SETATTR operation.
</t>
<t>
A detailed description of the NFS SETATTR operation can be
found in Section 18.30 of
<xref target="RFC5661"/>.

 title="Sending IMA Metadata When Creating a New Object"
 anchor="section:D7663BDC-A0C8-437D-88A5-1D79A3E7F9C2">
<t>
An alternate way to set an attribute is to provide the attribute
during an NFS OPEN(CREATE) operation.
Upon creation, an object has no content to protect.
If a client presents an FATTR4_IMA attribute
to an NFS version 4.2 server during NFS OPEN(CREATE),
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_INVAL.
</t>

</section>

<section
 title="Authorizing Updates to IMA Metadata"
 anchor="C17FEFF5-F9F8-46C4-AC3D-1B04DF704752">
<t>
An NFS server permits a user to replace a file's IMA metadata
whenever that user is permitted to modify that file's
byte content.
This is consistent with similar mechanisms already used
throughout the NFS version 4 protocol;
for instance, setting an ACL.
If an NFS server determines that a user requesting
a SETATTR with the FATTR4_IMA attribute
is not authorized to update the IMA metadata,
the SETATTR operation MUST return NFS4ERR_ACCESS.
</t>
<t>
If an NFS server implementation does not support
modification of IMA metadata via NFS,
the server MUST return NFS4ERR_INVAL to a
SETATTR request with the FATTR4_IMA attribute,
as required by Section 5.5 of
<xref target="RFC5661"/>.
</t>

<section
 title="Retrieving IMA Metadata"
 anchor="section:3F3277B1-50F2-4317-9707-1A27FE3B0112">
<t>
An NFS version 4.2 client retrieves IMA metadata
by retrieving the FATTR4_IMA attribute
via an NFS GETATTR operation,
specifying the file handle of the object
associated with the metadata to be retrieved.
</t>
<t>
The IMA subsystem typically manages its own cache
of this metadata to maintain reasonable performance.
The NFS client implementation MUST always pass
retrieval requests for this metadata to the server.
This metadata MUST NOT be cached by the NFS client.
</t>
<t>
When an NFS GETATTR is presented to an NFS version 4.2 server
and the target object resides in a file system
which supports the FATTR4_IMA attribute
but the object does not support the FATTR4_IMA attribute,
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_WRONGTYPE.
For example, if the server's file system supports associating
IMA metadata with regular files but not named attributes, then
the result of an attempt to retrieve IMA metadata on a named attribute
will be NFS4ERR_WRONGTYPE.
</t>
<t>
When an NFS GETATTR is presented to an NFS version 4.2 server
but the target object resides in a file system which does not
support FATTR4_IMA,
this does not result in an error and
the FATTR4_IMA attribute bit is cleared
in the server's response.
</t>
<t>
Otherwise, if the target object supports FATTR4_IMA
and there is no IMA metadata is available for the
target object,
the server returns a FATTR4_IMA attribute
whose length is zero.
</t>
<t>
When a client presents an NFS GETATTR that retrieves FATTR4_IMA
along with other attributes and the server responds with
an error, the client can retry by retrieving each attribute
separately to sort out which attribute is causing the
server to reject the NFS GETATTR operation.

 title="Using NFS Attribute Fencing (VERIFY/NVERIFY)"

<t>
The NFS VERIFY and NVERIFY operations,
described in Sections 18.31 and 18.15 of
<xref target="RFC5661"/> respectively,
permit a client to add a fence in an NFS COMPOUND where,
if a provided FATTR4 attribute does or does not match,
the server can force processing of that COMPOUND to stop.
The FATTR4_IMA attribute is a valid choice for these
operations.
</t>
<t>
The server MUST use a simple byte comparison to evaluate whether
the client-provided FATTR4_IMA matches the FATTR4_IMA attribute
associated with the target object.
If the server has a local IMA implementation,
it MAY prevent the use of the local FATTR4_IMA attribute value
for the purpose of this comparison (via EVM protection).
If the client has indicated support for IMA metadata,
the server MUST respond with NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY.
Otherwise it MUST respond with NFS4ERR_ACCESS.

Lastly, we provide the following possible simple appraisal policies
that might be applied by an appraiser:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Strict:">
Access is prevented to a file's content if the file has no IMA metadata
or if the extant IMA metadata fails to verify the file content.
Otherwise access to the file's content is not prevented.
</t>
<t hangText="Audit:">
Access to a file's content is never prevented.
Warnings are reported when a file has no IMA metadata
or when extant IMA metadata fails to verify the file's content.
</t>
<t hangText="Disabled:">
IMA metadata is ignored and
access to file content is never prevented.

 title="Instantiating IMA Metadata"
 anchor="section:548BF993-DE7D-4752-80C5-6628073606BE">
<t>
Once a file is written and closed,
a specialized tool
generates and signs the IMA metadata
and then writes it to the file system.
The tool can be used on a full-function client to sign
files on a participating server.
Or, the tool can be used on a full-function server to sign local files.
The IMA metadata is then visible to participating clients
and local users on the server (if there are any).
Or, an enhanced version of cpio or rsync might copy the metadata
into place as part of an installation procedure.
</t>
<t>
Typically, once IMA metadata is associated with a file,
the file's content is essentially immutable, even if the file's
permissions settings permit writing to it.
This is because changing the content without updating the associated
IMA metadata will make the file's content inaccessible,
depending on the appraisal policy in effect.
</t>
<t>
Updating file content requires access to a signing key
in order to generate fresh IMA metadata
to prevent subsequent IMA appraisal failures.
Typically a key like this will be well-protected, and thus
not available on NFS clients.

 title="Interaction With Legacy Implementations"
 anchor="section:2004C060-4504-44A6-A702-CDCA40C006C6">
<t>
Given the example policies and definitions we provided earlier,
the following statements are true:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A participating client that uses the Disabled policy
is equivalent to a legacy client,
except that a participating server is allowed to respond with
NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY to a participating client.
</t>
<t>
A legacy client
never prevents access to file content on a participating server,
but a participating server that has a local appraiser
may prevent access of a corrupted file to a legacy client.
</t>
<t>
A participating client using the Strict policy
never allows access to files stored on a legacy server.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
An appraiser on a participating NFS version 4.2 peer
needs to be prepared to deal gracefully
with IMA metadata it does not recognize or cannot parse.
Its policy may treat this case as an appraisal failure.
</t>
<t>
It is not required for an NFS version 4.2 server to
implement an appraiser.
However, some servers, such as the Linux NFS server, do just that,
applying local IMA policy to both local and remote file accesses.
</t>
<t>
If an appraisal failure occurs during a remote access,
a participating server responds to a legacy client with NFS4ERR_ACCESS.
The server's local policy decides exactly what a participating client sees:
Possibilities include
an NFS4ERR_INTEGRITY response (and access to the file is denied),
or
access to the file content and IMA metadata may be permitted so that
the client's own IMA policies can be applied.

 title="Security Considerations"
 anchor="section:83D5C960-0148-42FA-93E4-3DE7F96EFD34">
<t>
The design of the NFS extension described in this document assumes
that IMA metadata in transit and at rest is cryptographically signed
to prevent unwanted alteration.
</t>
<t>
When IMA metadata for a file exists and the end host has an active appraiser,
the content of a file is protected from creation to use.
Receivers can reliably detect unintentional or malicious alteration of file content
by verifying its content using the file's IMA metadata.
Additional protection of file content while at rest or in transit
on an untrusted network is unnecessary.
</t>
<t>
Likewise, receivers can also reliably detect unintentional or malicious alteration
of IMA metadata that is cryptographically signed,
simply by verifying its signature.
Additional protection of signed metadata
while at rest or in transit on an untrusted network is unnecessary.
</t>
<t>
Like other mechanisms that protect data integrity during transit,
a malicious agent or a network malfunction
can create a denial-of-service condition
by repeatedly triggering integrity verification failures on NFS version 4.2 clients.
</t>
<t>
To prevent a malicious denial-of-service attempt
by altering IMA metadata at rest,
an NFS version 4.2 server can enforce a suitable level of privilege
before authorizing a local or remote agent to alter this information.
